Basic lighting (i.e. diffuse and specular)
2D collision with the objects

Post processing
Advance materials and Shaders
Advance lighting and multiple lights
Normal mapping
Procedural texturing
Dynamic Geometry
Modelling / in-build editing tools

Post processing effects - bloom, glow
Parallax mapping, lighting calculations in tangent space
Animation
Image-based lighting, HDR lighting
Motion blur, depth-of-field
Deferred rendering

Just done:
changed the tilt of the camera and the height of it, now it's 3rd person and can see when barrier past the object

Issues:


Need to ask Karsten: UI is just not displaying


Make the window resizable
Model Height isn't perfect
Lighting geos black as soon as the obj reaches a certain distance
It doesn't look perfect, so i want to change up the lighting
and then lets start working on the enemies
and then lets start working on the UI


Plan:
get player health = 3
If player y pos and the barrier pos is same
	check if lane is same, if yes
	health = health - 0
display health and score
