Issue:
2. Create a lightShader to make it point down on to the road 
(Create 3 lights in a row first, to accommodate the player spawn lights)
3. Create the same thing as scores for lives 
(Just add a death PNG when player has gone past 0)
Just update the lives png (check if player still have more than 0 lives then update texture)
4. Just add a death screen after death
